# Binary Representation

Computers, at their core, are built using electronic circuits.\
They operate based on the presence or absence of electric signals (on and off), which are represented as 1s and 0s, respectively. 
- These 1s and 0s are the fundamental units of information in the **binary number system**, which is the language that computers understand and process.

On the other hand, humans have traditionally used the **decimal number system (base 10)** for counting and arithmetic operations. 

The decimal system is more intuitive for us because we have ten fingers, making it easier to conceptualize and work with numbers that range from 0 to 9.

**Knowing how to convert between decimal and binary numbers is essential for solving certain type of computational problems.**

# Example 

Suppose we want to represent the number "10" in both binary and decimal systems. 

In the decimal system, we write it as "10," which is a single digit representing ten units.

However, in the binary system, "10" is represented as "1010," where each digit (0 or 1) is called a bit (binary digit).
