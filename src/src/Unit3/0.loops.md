# Loops

In computing, there will be tasks/operations where you will have to perform the same tasks again and again.

So how does a computer perform a task repeatedly without manually repeating the same code over and over again.

Loops, as the name suggests, allowed the Python to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, saving it from the tedious task of writing the same code again and again.

# `for` loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.

In other words, it is used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, a string, or a range of numbers.

```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    # the f string syntax below is used to print the value of a variable inside a string --> Called a f-string
    print(f"I love eating {fruit}s!") 

# Output:
# I love eating apples!
# I love eating bananas!
# I love eating cherries!
```

In this example, the for loop iterates over each item in the fruits list, and for each iteration, the loop body (the indented code block) is executed with the current item bound to the variable fruit.

# `while` loop

This loop is perfect for situations where the Python needed to repeat a set of instructions **until a certain condition is met**

```python
# Counting down from 5
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(f"Counting down... {count}")
    count -= 1 # meaning count = count - 1
print("Liftoff!")

# Output:
# Counting down... 5
# Counting down... 4
# Counting down... 3
# Counting down... 2
# Counting down... 1
# Liftoff!
```

In this example, the while loop continues to execute the loop body as long as the condition count > 0 is true.

Inside the loop, the value of count is printed, and then it is decremented by 1. Once count becomes 0, the loop condition is no longer true, and the loop terminates, printing "Liftoff!" after the loop.

# Nested Loops

Loops can be nested inside other loops. This means that you can put one loop inside the body of another loop.

```python
# Printing a multiplication table
for i in range(1, 11): # i goes from 1 to 10
    for j in range(1, 11): # j goes from 1 to 10
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")
    print("--------------------")

# Output:
# 1 x 1 = 1
# 1 x 2 = 2
# ...
# 1 x 10 = 10
# --------------------
# 2 x 1 = 2
# 2 x 2 = 4
# ...
# 2 x 10 = 20
# --------------------
# ...
# -------------------- # Last step:
# 10 x 1 = 10
# 10 x 2 = 20
# ...
# 10 x 10 = 100
# --------------------
```

# Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence --> `break` and `continue`.

In other words, they allow you to control how a loop executes a code.

## `break` statement

The `break` statement is used to **exit** the loop prematurely, regardless of the loop condition.

```python
# Breaking out of a loop
for i in range(1, 11): # varible i goes from 1 to 10
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

```
In the above example:

Loop breaks and it does not print 5 --> The loop stops when i == 5 and exits out of the loop
- **The same applies for while loops too**

## `continue` statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only.

In other words, it **skips** the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.

```python
# Skipping an iteration
for i in range(1, 9):
    if i == 5: 
        continue # Skip the rest of the code inside the loop if i is 5
    print(i)

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 6
# 7
# 8
``` 

In the above example:

The value of `i` becomes 5, the `continue` statement is executed, and the rest of the code inside the loop is skipped. 

The loop then continues with the next iteration.
- The same applies for while loops too

# `for` loop examples

```python
# ==================
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# ==================
# Iterating over a string
greeting = "Hello, World!"
for char in greeting:
    print(char)
# Output:
# H
# e
# l
# l
# o
# ,
#
# W
# o
# r
# l
# d
# !

# ==================
# Iterating over a range
for i in range(5): # i goes from 0 to 4
    print(i)
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# ==================
# Iterating with index
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for i, color in enumerate(colors): # i is the index, color is the value --> This is how enumerate() works: It returns the index and the value
    print(f"{i}: {color}")
# Output:
# 0: red
# 1: green
# 2: blue

# ==================
# Iterating over a list with conditional
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0: # Research the % operator
        print(num)
# Output:
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10

# ==================
# Iterating over multiple sequences
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for name, age in zip(names, ages): # zip() function is used to combine two or more sequences
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
# Output:
# Alice is 25 years old.
# Bob is 30 years old.
# Charlie is 35 years old.

# ==================
# Nested for loops
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] # Array inside an array: Imagine it as a 3x3 matrix
# matrix[0] = [1, 2, 3]
# matrix[1] = [4, 5, 6]
# matrix[0][0] = 1
# matrix[0][1] = 2
# matrix[1][2] = 6
for row in matrix: # Loop through each row
    for element in row: # Loop through each element in the row
        print(element + " ") # Print the element and a space
    print()
# Output:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9

# ==================
# For loop with else --> Special for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
else:
    print("Loop completed")
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# Loop completed
```

# `while` loop examples

```python
# ==================
# Basic while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1 # Increment the count by 1
    # if count == 5, the loop will stop

    # NOTE:  if count variable is not incremented, the loop will run forever
    # This is called an infinite loop: because count will always be 0 and count < 5 will always be true

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# ==================
# Infinite loop (until break)
count = 0
while True: # Intentionally creating an infinite loop
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count == 5: # Break out of the loop when count is 5: 
        # This is the only way to exit the loop
        break
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# ==================
# While loop with else: also a special while loop
num = 0
while num < 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1
else:
    print("Loop completed")
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Loop completed

# ==================
# While loop with conditional
num = 10
while num > 0:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)
    num -= 1 # num = num - 1
# Output:
# 10
# 8
# 6
# 4
# 2

# ==================
# While loop with user input
user_input = ""
while user_input.lower() != "quit":
    # Keep on asking user for input until the user types 'quit'
    user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
print("Loop exited")
# Output:
# Enter 'quit' to exit: hello
# Enter 'quit' to exit: world
# Enter 'quit' to exit: quit
# Loop exited

# ==================
# Nested while loops
i = 1
while i <= 3: # run until i is greater than 3, if i becomes greater than 3, stop running the outsite loop
    j = 1
    while j <= 3: # run until i is greater than 3, if i becomes greater than 3, stop running this inside loop
        print(f"({i}, {j})")
        j += 1
    i += 1
# Output:
# (1, 1)
# (1, 2)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (2, 3)
# (3, 1)
# (3, 2)
# (3, 3)
