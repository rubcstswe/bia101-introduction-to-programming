# Lists/Array Methods


There are various methods to change/edit values of a list as shown in the code snippets below

NOTE: The properties of Stacks and Queues can be achieved using list methods like `.pop()` `.remove()` `.insert()` etc.

```python
# ==================
# Getting the length of the list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
# Note: The length is not 0 based (counting starts from 1 unlike indexing)
length = len(numbers) 
print(length) # 4

# ==================
# Accessing Elements
# The index starts from 0 and not 1
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
second_number = numbers[1]
print(second_number)  # Output: 20

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
last_fruit = fruits[2]  # Accessing the first element
print(last_fruit)  # Output: cherry

# Negative Indexing: Start from the last:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]
last_fruit = fruits[-1]  # Accessing the last element
print(last_fruit)  # Output: orange

# Accessing Slices: Same concept as String Slices
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sublist = numbers[1:4]  # Accessing a sublist from index 1 to 4 (exclusive)
print(sublist)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]

# ==================
# Removing Elements
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
del numbers[1]
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 30, 40]

# Remove elements by value:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana"]
fruits.remove("banana")  # Removing the first occurrence of "banana"
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "cherry", "banana"]

# ==================
# Modifying Elements
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
numbers[2] = 55
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 55, 40]

# ==================
# Appending Elements
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
numbers.append(80)
print(numbers)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 80]

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("cherry")  # Adding an element to the end
print(fruits)  # Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Insert an element at a specific index:
numbers = [1, 3, 5]
numbers.insert(1, 2)  # Inserting 2 at index 1
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]

# ==================
# Extending Elements
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
more_numbers = [4, 5, 6]
numbers.extend(more_numbers)
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# using `in` operator and `not in` operator to check for elements in the array
# The concept here is as same as the operator used in strings
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
is_present = "green" in colors
print(is_present)  # Output: True

# =============
